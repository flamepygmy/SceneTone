15. April 2022:

  This is a snapshot of the SceneTone project sources as they exist in my private local git repo. This is released
  mainly for archival purposes and/or if anyone still is using Symbian/S60 devices and want to build this thing.

  Everything is released as-is and without any warranties of whether it will compile. Notably missing from here are
  the external pacakges esidplay and libmikmod it depends on, though they may still be available.

  Everything below this comment is mostly as it was when it was last released (0.11). I don't exactly know if this
  contains some work past 0.11 release or not.

 What is it
------------

This program is a music player for Nokia S60 3rd edition platform that is able to play old module formats
such as Soundtracker, Protracker, S3M, and XM. Also, Commodore 64 .SID files can be played. Player also
supports generating of .WAV files to a fixed location in the file system to be used as a ringtone.
Support for these formats come from external packages (parts of these packages are linked to the application):

	- ESidPlay 014 (Alfred E. Heggestad), EPOC Sid player that includes libsidplay (Michael Schwendt)
	    * libsidplay is licensed under GPL
	    * download from http://esidplay.sourceforge.net/pub/esidplay.src.014.tar.gz

	- libmikmod 3.1.11 (Jef Poskanzer)
 	    * libmikmod is licensed under  LGPL
	    * download from http://mikmod.raphnet.net/files/libmikmod-3.1.11.tar.gz


Scenetone itself is licensed under GPL.


Note: scenetone is a hobby project (which I don't have much time for), so please don't spam me with millions of feature requests.
If you do have some features that you want to the player (and they are generally usefull for people using the SW :-), send me a diff
against the latest release with a short explanation what the patch actually does.

 How to Fetch
--------------

  1. Download S60 3rd edition SDK and install it with GCCE compiler support

  2. Copy this project under your SDK directory (where EPOC32 directory is located)

  3. Download ESidPlay and uncompress to folder:

	scenetone/scenetone_sid		(/esidplay)

  4. Download libmikmod 3.1.11 and uncompress to folder:

	scenetone/scenetone_mikmod	(/libmikmod-3.1.11)

 How to configure
------------------

  1. Go to scenetone/scenetone_mikmod/libmikdmod-3.1.11 folder (under cygwin, BUT without Symbian tools in path) and type:

	./configure

  2. Go to scenetone/scenetone_sid and run patch under cygwin (to patch some friend errors in code):

	patch -p0 < ./fix_friend_errors.diff

 How to Compile
----------------

 Alternative 1 (ready made build script for cygwin that has been rigged for Symbian compilation):

  1. Just type 'build.sh'

 Alternative 2:

  1. Go to scenetone/scenetone_mikmod/group folder and type (will compile mikmod support):

	bldmake bldfiles
	abld build gcce urel

  2. Go to scenetone/scenetone_sid/group folder and type (will compile sidplay support):

	bldmake bldfiles
	abld build gcce urel

  3. Go to scenetone/scenetone_wav/group folder and type (will compile wav support):

	bldmake bldfiles
	abld build gcce urel

  4. Go to scenetone/group folder and type (will compile the actual application):

	bldmake bldfiles
	abld build gcce urel

  5. Go to scenetone/sis folder and type (will create a install file and sign it with the self-signing
     key provided):

	createsis create scenetone_gcce.pkg

Now your install file is ready in the scenetone/sis folder as "scenetone_gcce.sis". This can be installed
to the phone.



 How to use
------------

Press menu button to choose a file to play from the file system. When the tune starts playing the controls are:

   UP KEY = next subsong, DOWN KEY = previous subsong, LEFT KEY = decrease volume, RIGHT KEY = increase volume
   "4" key = previous module in the last used folder for module selection, "6" key = next module.

When certain subsong of a module is playing, you can select "Generate WAV" from the menu to generate a .WAV
file to "c:\Data\Sounds\Digital\scenetone.wav". This .WAV file can be set as your ringtone in your profile
settings. If you keep this .WAV file as your ringtone, you can generate new .WAV files directly from the
scenetone without the need to change profile settings.

After you have chosen some directory and started song playback from that directory, select "Grab Defaultpath"
from the menu to grab that directory as the future default directory to open modules from. Note: the setting
will only be stored at the application exit for now.
