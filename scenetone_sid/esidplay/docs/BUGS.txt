Known bugs in ESidPlay
----------------------

001 Stopping a playing song takes too long ( > 2 seconds) This should
    be much lower. Perhaps it is because the sound is still in the buffer
    in the driver ? 

002 The second time you start SidPlay it will exit with 'Not Found'
    Must reboot emulator to fix it.

003 On exit, SidPlay creates some files in C:\Documents. This is wrong.

004 When browsing for files, it always goes to C:\Documents first, even
    though C:\sid is specied.
