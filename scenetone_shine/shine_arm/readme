Shine (RISC OS fixed point port)

This port of Gabriel Bouvigne's Shine has been converted to fixed point
to reduce encoding time on Acorn/RISC OS computers without hardware
floating point coprocessors.

For use on other platforms, the RISC OS specifics in main.c should be
undefined, and the assembler fractional multiply functions will need to
be changed. Big endian support may also have to be re-instated.
