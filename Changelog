v0.10   29.4.2008	Jani Vaarala

	"WAPPU"-release:

	- fixed the "grab defaultpath" thing to work again
	- new open modes: from default folder or full open (with memory selection etc.)
	- SW Volume in addition to existing HW volume (SW volume scales the samples down, NOTE:
	  this is done in WAV generation and playback!) to get even lower volume levels
	- capturing begin and end position for wav generation during song playback (center of direction controller)
	- new info display that shows HW and SW volume levels
	- new filebrowser: shows two previous and two next songs and also
	- timeout when switching songs to make scrolling faster (starts after selection has been still for 0.5 secs)
	- new key layout:
	                      up/down to change song, left/right to change subsong
			      center  to mark start of capture and end of capture (will be used for next wav gen)
			      2/8     to change SW volume, 4/6 to change HW volume
